# GoodCabs-Operational-Analysis

# Project - Summary
This project is an in-depth operational analysis for Goodcabs, a growing cab service company targeting tier-2 cities in India. The analysis leverages SQL for data querying and Power BI for interactive dashboards, enabling the company to track, assess, and improve their performance against ambitious 2024 growth and passenger satisfaction targets.

Through this project, I created four comprehensive dashboards:

1. Trips Analysis: Insights into trip volume, distribution, and trends.
2. Revenue Analysis: Performance of total and average revenue metrics, including monthly growth trends.
3. Passenger Analysis: Passenger segmentation, repeat rate, and satisfaction metrics.
4. Target Analysis: Progress tracking of key metrics against predefined targets.

# Problem Statement
Goodcabs, a cab service company established two years ago, has carved a niche in the Indian market by prioritizing tier-2 cities. Unlike traditional cab services, Goodcabs emphasizes empowering local drivers, ensuring a sustainable livelihood in their hometowns, and delivering exceptional passenger experiences. Operating in ten tier-2 cities across India, the company has set ambitious goals for 2024, focusing on growth and improved passenger satisfaction.

This project centers on analyzing Goodcabs’ operational data from January 2024 to June 2024. The goal is to evaluate the company’s performance across critical metrics like trip volume, passenger satisfaction, and revenue growth. By developing interactive dashboards, this project aims to deliver actionable insights that support data-driven decision-making and help Goodcabs achieve its strategic objectives.
